# OXY-GEN Demo

This project was generated by [OXY-GEN](https://github.com/ASteinheiser/generator-oxy-gen), an open-source cli tool that helps developers quickly create native desktop apps using React and Rust!

It uses Electron to build the native app, create-react-app for the React side, and uses Web Assembly to bind the Rust functions.

OXY-GEN includes a recursive fibonacci algorithm written in Node.js and Rust. It uses Web Workers to run both languages in parallel to showcase the speed difference.
